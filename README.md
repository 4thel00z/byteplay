## What it is

byteplay was a module that made it easy to tinker with the executable
bytecode of a Python function in Python 2.
The original code is still available from pypi
(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/byteplay/0.2) and is still functional with Python 2.7.

This is byteplay3 which brings that capability to Python 3.4+.

For a full explanation with code examples see the new "about" file at
https://github.com/tallforasmurf/byteplay/blob/master/about.md

**At this time byteplay3 is a work in progress**.

## Why this fork?

I (tallforasmurf) would like to play with byteplay on Python 3,
which the original does not support.
I've made this fork (by export from code.google.com)
to investigate the possibility of converting it to Python 3.

The file byteplay3.py is my edited version for Python 3.
